  itemInfo: 'Sandy: Zhenglin was fired from the company a few days ago, and I heard
    that he was hospitalized recently. It seemed like a car accident.

    

    Matty:
    Oh my god, this is too bad. Since he left, the vitality of our department has
    dropped instantly. He was the backbone of our department before, and many employees
    asked him to complain and he was very popular with everyone.

    

    Sandy:
    Yeah, hey, the company is such a jerk

    

    Matty: (Hush), keep your voice
    down. Be careful to be heard by Grey. He is famously omniscient

    

    Steven:hello,

    

    Sandy:
    Hello, is everything going well?

    

    Steven: Hey, it''s uncomfortable.
    Recently, my back hurts a bit. What else are you talking about

    

    Matty:
    Ah, we just talked about zhenglin. . .

    

    Steven: (Hush), keep your
    voice down. in fact. . . He is an informer.

    

    Sandy: Really? To be
    honest, I am very supportive of him very much. I don''t want to stay in this
    place either. But then I will lose my job. Garbage company

    

    Steven:
    I also heard that Nathan was recently praised by the senior management for some
    reason.

    

    Matty: This bastard, He should be sanctioned.

    

    Sandy:
    Just bear it. It''s time for my break, I''m leaving now
